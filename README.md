# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Janki Broker

I'm a passionate AI and ML enthusiast to become an AI/ML engineer or researcher. My primary focus is on solving the coherence problem in Large Language Models (LLMs) and optimizing the data requirements for their effective operation.

## ðŸ§  Neuro-Inspired AI

I believe that understanding how the human brain stores and retrieves information from long-term memory can provide valuable insights for enhancing LLMs. By leveraging my knowledge of brainwave patterns, I aim to develop neural network architectures that mimic the brain's ability to efficiently process and utilize data for problem-solving.

## ðŸ“œ Research and Publications

During my graduation, I completed a project on emotion analysis using EEG and EOG signals. I have since published a research paper on this topic, which is available on [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10498633) & Scopus Journal. This research has deepened my understanding of the relationship between brainwave signals and emotional states.

## ðŸ”§ Hands-on Experience

To further my research, I have designed and built my own IoT device from scratch. This device is capable of detecting EEG and EOG signals, enabling me to collect a unique dataset for analysis and model training. Through this hands-on experience, I have gained practical skills in hardware development and data acquisition.

## ðŸš€ Looking Forward

As I embark on my journey in the field of AI and ML, I am excited to collaborate with like-minded individuals and contribute to the advancement of LLMs. By combining my expertise in brainwave patterns, IoT device development, and data analysis, I strive to create innovative solutions that push the boundaries of what is possible with AI.

Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out to me for any exciting projects or collaborations!
